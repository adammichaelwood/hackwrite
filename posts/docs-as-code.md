## Practices

 - Docs are written in plain text formats such as Markdown or reStructured Text.
 - Docs are stored as flat files, not database entries.
 - Docs are authored in a code editor of the writer's choice, not a monolithic authoring application.
 - Docs are kept under version control.
 - Doc versions are organized in parallel to product versions.
 - Docs are built and deployed from source in an automated process that mirrors product deployment.
 - Docs are automatically tested for internal consistency and compliance to style guides.
 - Whenever reasonable, writers use the same tools and processes as developers.
 - Writers are integrated into the development team.

## Benefits

 - Writers have more control over their authoring environment.
 - Less friction in the authoring process.
 - Elimination of inconsistencies between docs and product.
 - Less need for human proofreading.
 - Coordinated releases of docs with product.
 - Developers are more likely to contribute to docs.
 - Writers and developers have more awareness of and respect for each others' work.
 - Authoring and deployment tools are mostly free; hosting requires less overhead.
